## About

[Beer Lovers](https://beer-lovers-app.herokuapp.com/) is a website where you can find information on great beers by type or food pairing. You may even be surprised by our beer expert, who will choose the ideal beer for you.

This project has no commercial or profitable purpose. It uses [The Punk API](https://punkapi.com/), which is a free and open-source API with [Brewdog](https://www.brewdog.com/uk/)'s catalogue of beer.

This website was made by [Tatiane Aguirres](https://tatianeaguirres.com/) as a fan's work to improve her Angular skills. Tatiane is a Front-end Developer Specialized in Visual and Web Accessibility.

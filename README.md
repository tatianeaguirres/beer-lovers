## About

[Beer Lovers](https://beer-lovers-app.herokuapp.com/) is a website where you can find information on great beers by type or food pairing. You may even be surprised by our beer expert, who will choose the ideal beer for you.

This project has no commercial or profitable purpose. It uses [The Punk API](https://punkapi.com/), which is a free and open-source API with [Brewdog](https://www.brewdog.com/uk/)'s catalogue of beer.

This website was made by [Tatiane Aguirres](https://tatianeaguirres.com/) as a fan's work to improve her Angular skills. Tatiane is a Front-end Developer Specialized in Visual and Web Accessibility.

## Running the application

### Development server

First, install all the dependencies with: `$ npm install`

Run `$ npm run dev` or `$ ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running the tests

### Unit tests

Run `$ npm run test` or `$ ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### End-to-end tests

Run `$ npm run e2e` or `$ ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Lint

Run `$ npm run lint` or `$ ng lint` to execute the lint via [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/).

## Troubleshooting

If you had any problem trying to run the application or the tests make sure that you have met the following requirements:

```
Node version: v12.8.0
Npm version: v6.14.5
```

## Technical Decisions

- Mobile-first.
- Fully responsive app for all screen sizes.
- App accessible to all users, including keyboard users and screen reader users.
- CSS structure based on [Matthias Ott's post](https://matthiasott.com/notes/how-i-structure-my-css/).
